<p>I am second year graduate student working with Dr. Changwoo Min at
System Software Research Group, Virgina Tech. My research interests
are in computer systems and architecture. I am particularly interested
in scalability of operating systems, concurrency and in-memory
database.</p>

<p> I earned my B.Tech in ECE from International Institute of
Information technology, Hyderabad in 2015. I worked as a system
software engineer at rENIAC, a startup working on accelerating NoSQL
databases using FPGA.</p>

<p> When I am not coding, I enjoy hiking, reading non-fiction books
and playing guitar. </p>
